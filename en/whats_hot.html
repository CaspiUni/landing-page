<h2>Website redesigned during the Hack Week III</h2>
<p>
  As part of Hack Week III, members of the openSUSE community
  <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-marketing/2008-08/msg00032.html">redesigned</a>
  this landing page for the openSUSE web site. The main ideas for the
  redesign are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide information about the openSUSE project.</li>
  <li>Display content in a visitor's native language.</li>
  <li>Make it easy for new users to get started with the openSUSE community.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We have worked very hard on the redesign to make the page accessible,
  even for browsers with JavaScript disabled. Text-only browsers are
  also supported.
</p>
<p>
  Enjoy your visit, and have a lot of fun!
