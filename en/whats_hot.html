<h2>openSUSE 13.1: Ready For Action!</h2>


<p>Dear contributors, friends and fans:
<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/?p=16841">The release is here</a>!
Eight months of planning, packaging, adding features, fixing issues, testing and
fixing more issues has brought you the best that Free and Open Source has to
offer, with our Green touch: Stable and Awesome.</p>

<p>
This release did benefit from the improvements to our testing infrastructure and
much attention for bug fixing. While a combination of over 6000 packages
supporting 5 architectures can never be perfect, we're proud to say this really
does represent the best Free Software has to offer! The latest desktops (five of
them!), server and cloud technologies, software development tools and everything
in between are included as well as a number of exciting, new technologies for
you to play with. Enjoy!<br/>
