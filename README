This are the sources for the www.opensuse.org startpage. 

The page is hosted at Novell: 130.57.4.24 (mehle@novell, scweber@novell.com)
it includes some static files from: //static.opensuse.org/hosts/www.o.o (tom@suse)

so both systems need to be updated on changes. The sources are hosted at: git@github.com:openSUSE/landing-page.git

The page uses SSI includes, a wysiwyg editor for the hot_stuff part, and a cronjob that creates the news part. 
XXX: is that still valid? ^

After deploying, please run fix_permissions.sh to make the files writeable for the editor. 

note about translations: (reverse engineered by lnussel)
# install the tools
$ zypper in po4a
# add your stuff
$ vi en/en/whats_hot.html
# generate pot file
$ make_POT.sh
# remove old translations
$ echo */po/*.po|xargs rm
# merge new translations
$ ./make_PO_to_HTML.sh
# check what happened
$ git status
# remove the languages that vanished from languages.html
$ vi languages.html
