<h2>openSUSE 12.2: Green Means Go!</h2>

<p>Dear users, developers, and Geekos around the world - <a
href="http://news.opensuse.org/2012/09/05/opensuse-12-2-green-means-go/">openSUSE
12.2</a> is ready for you! Two months of extra stabilization work have
resulted into a stellar release, chock-full of goodies, yet stable as you
all like it.</p>

<p>The latest release of the world's most powerful and flexible Linux
Distribution brings you speed-ups across the board with a faster storage
layer in Linux 3.4 and accelerated functions in glibc and Qt, giving a more
fluid and responsive KDE desktop. The infrastructure below openSUSE has
evolved, bringing in mature new technologies like GRUB2 and Plymouth and the
first steps in the direction of a revised and simplified UNIX file system
hierarchy.  Users will also notice the added polish to existing features
bringing an improved user experience all over. The novel Btrfs file system
comes with improved error handling and recovery tools, GNOME 3.4, developing
rapidly, brings smooth scrolling to all applications and features a reworked
System Settings and Contacts manager while XFCE has an enhanced application
finder.<br/>
