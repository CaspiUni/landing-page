<h2>openSUSE 12.3 - Awesome as 1-2-3</h2>

<p>Dear contributors, friends and fans: the latest version of the openSUSE
distribution, 12.3, <a
href="https://news.opensuse.org/2013/03/13/opensuse-12-3-free-open-and-awesome">is
ready for you</a>! After 6 months of hard work, we are happy to bring you
the mash of the best things that Free and Open Source Software has to offer
with the unique green sauce - stable, friendly and fun.</p>

<p>As this was a shorter-than-normal release cycle, much attention went into
the details and we bring you a very refurbished product. This release of the
world&#39;s most powerful and flexible Linux Distribution gives the
finishing touch to our boot infrastructure and package management, a bright
polish to your desktop and a touch of cloud for your server.<br/>
